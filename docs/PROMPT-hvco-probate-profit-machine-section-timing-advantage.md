You are designing Section 3 of a short-form landing page for real estate investors.

SECTION PURPOSE:
Introduce the idea that probate success is driven by timing — and set up intrigue around Timeline Intelligence without explaining it.

VISUAL STYLE:
- Headline on the left
- Short 2–3 sentence blurb under the headline
- On the right: a large placeholder graphic container
- The graphic should slide in from the side on scroll
- Label the graphic placeholder “Probate Timeline / Silver Wave Visualization”

CONTENT DIRECTION:
- Use the “Silver Wave” concept to show timing, not fear
- Emphasize that probate opportunities unfold in stages
- Make investors realize most people arrive too late

GUARDRAILS:
- Do NOT explain Timeline Intelligence yet
- Do NOT include technical charts
- Do NOT mention AI here
- Keep the copy high-level and intriguing

OUTPUT:
- Section headline
- Short blurb copy
- Placeholder description for the sliding graphic
