# Probate Lead Source Competitor Intelligence
_Last updated: Dec 2025_

This document analyzes the **actual probate lead vendors and educators** competing with Homeflip.ai.

This is not a CRM comparison.
This is not a marketing software comparison.

This document exists to:
- Expose how probate lead sources *really* work
- Identify structural weaknesses in list-based probate models
- Provide positioning ammunition for Homeflip.ai as a probate intelligence platform

## How Probate Lead Vendors Actually Operate

Across nearly all providers, the workflow looks like this:

1. Pull probate data from county courts
2. Normalize names, addresses, filing dates
3. Deliver data as a **static list**
4. Consider the job “done”

What happens *after* delivery is ignored:
- Estate progress
- Inventory filings
- Property listings
- Case inactivity
- Changing urgency

This disconnect is the market failure.

## Core Competitors (Detailed)

### :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

**What MTI Really Is:**  
An education company that teaches investors *how to manually do probate*.

**How Data Is Sourced:**
- Students are taught to pull probate filings directly from county courts
- Often manual searches, PDFs, or clerk portals
- Sometimes assisted by third-party list pulls

**Delivery Model:**
- CSV or spreadsheet
- One-time pull per period
- No updates unless the student re-pulls manually

**Operational Reality for Investors:**
- Students often pull hundreds of cases
- No signal for which cases matter *now*
- No visibility into where a case sits in the probate lifecycle
- High upfront motivation → rapid burnout

**Failure Mode:**
> Investors confuse “having probate leads” with “having probate opportunities.”

**Why This Model Persists:**
- Education scales better than data
- Responsibility shifts to the student
- Failure is blamed on execution, not the system

---

### :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

**What They Really Are:**  
A lead reseller competing primarily on price.

**How Data Is Sourced:**
- Aggregated from public record vendors
- Often delayed relative to court filings
- Probate is one of many list types

**Delivery Model:**
- Monthly CSV drops
- Same data sold to many investors
- No exclusivity, no lifecycle tracking

**Operational Reality for Investors:**
- Lists feel “cheap but cold”
- High overlap with other buyers
- Investors call cases months or years too early
- Many heirs have no urgency or intent

**Failure Mode:**
> Investors burn time chasing estates that are not yet actionable.

**Why This Model Persists:**
- Investors optimize for cost per record
- Not cost per deal
- Vendors are not measured on outcomes

---

### :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

**What They Really Are:**  
A traditional probate list vendor with niche focus.

**How Data Is Sourced:**
- Court filings pulled on a schedule
- Basic normalization (name, address, filing date)

**Delivery Model:**
- Monthly subscription
- County-based CSVs
- Minimal change tracking

**Operational Reality for Investors:**
- Filing date is treated as the key data point
- No context for:
  - Inventory filed
  - Property disposition
  - Estate delays
- Lists age immediately after delivery

**Failure Mode:**
> Probate cases are treated as static when they are inherently dynamic.

**Why This Model Persists:**
- Simple to explain
- Familiar to wholesalers
- Low operational overhead for vendor

---

### :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

**What They Really Are:**  
A higher-quality probate data provider — but still list-based.

**How Data Is Sourced:**
- Direct court data
- More fields than cheaper vendors
- Better normalization

**Delivery Model:**
- Periodic exports
- Some refresh capability
- Still fundamentally batch-based

**Operational Reality for Investors:**
- Better raw data
- Same decision problem
- No guidance on *when* to act
- No prioritization logic

**Failure Mode:**
> Better data does not fix timing blindness.

**Why This Model Persists:**
- Appeals to experienced investors
- “Better inputs” feels like progress
- Still avoids ongoing responsibility

## The Core Structural Problem (Across All Vendors)

### Probate Is a Timeline — Vendors Sell Snapshots

Probate has stages:
- Filing
- Inventory
- Delays
- Listings
- Resolution

Most vendors deliver:
- One row
- One date
- No change detection

The **filing date** is usually the *least* useful signal.

---

### No One Answers the Investor’s Real Questions

Investors want to know:
- Which cases just became urgent?
- Which cases should I ignore *for now*?
- What changed since last week?
- Who should I call today?

List vendors answer none of these.

---

### No Feedback Loop

Vendors do not learn:
- Which cases converted
- Which signals predicted success
- Which timelines mattered

So the product never improves.

---

## Homeflip.ai’s Competitive Reframe (As a Lead Source)

Homeflip.ai does not sell:
- Lists
- CSVs
- Monthly drops

Homeflip.ai sells:
- **Probate intelligence**
- **Timing awareness**
- **Continuity after purchase**

### Key Reframe:
> Probate leads are not records — they are evolving situations.

### Structural Differentiators:
- Court-synced updates
- Event-aware tracking
- Status changes over time
- Signal-based prioritization
- Designed around *actionability*, not volume

---

## Positioning Contrast (Language-Level)

**Traditional Vendors Say:**
> “Here’s your probate list for the month.”

**Homeflip.ai Can Say:**
> “Here are the probate cases that just moved closer to sale.”

Or:
> “Most probate leads are already cold when you get them.”

Or:
> “Probate isn’t about being early — it’s about being on time.”

---

## Strategic Summary

The probate lead market optimizes for:
- Ease of delivery
- Low responsibility
- Volume over clarity

Homeflip.ai optimizes for:
- Timing
- Context
- Investor confidence

This positions Homeflip.ai as:
> **A probate intelligence layer — not a list vendor.**
