You are designing Section 1 of a short-form landing page for real estate investors.

SECTION PURPOSE:
Create urgency around why probate opportunities are expanding *right now* without sounding alarmist or academic.

VISUAL STYLE:
- Large, confident headline at the top
- Below the headline: 2–3 short paragraphs (no long blocks)
- Beneath the text: 3 horizontal “info boxes” with large numbers + short labels
- Subtle fade-in or upward motion on scroll (no flashy animation)

CONTENT DIRECTION:
- Frame probate as a demographic inevitability (not a trend)
- Emphasize scale, timing, and inevitability
- Avoid heavy statistics dumps; keep numbers rounded and human-readable

EXAMPLE THEMES (do not copy verbatim):
- Baby boomers control a disproportionate share of housing
- A growing number of properties are entering probate each year
- This supply shift is happening regardless of market cycles

GUARDRAILS:
- Do NOT explain solutions yet
- Do NOT mention Timeline Intelligence yet
- No fear-based language (“crash”, “collapse”)
- Keep tone calm, confident, investor-focused

OUTPUT:
- Section headline
- Body copy
- Placeholder info box labels (e.g. “X Homes”, “Y Owners”, “Z Timeline”)
