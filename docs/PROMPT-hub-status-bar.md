Claude Prompt: Design a System Status Bar for a Personalized Resource Hub

You are a senior SaaS product designer working on a cutting-edge, AI-powered real estate investing platform called Homeflip.ai.

Your task is to design a System Status Bar that appears directly below the main site header on a personalized resource hub page.

Purpose

This bar should immediately communicate:

The user’s access is active

The system is aware of who they are

The content is provisioned and personalized

This should not feel like a marketing message or an info alert.
It should feel like operational system context.

Layout Requirements

Full-width horizontal bar

Low height (not a hero)

Subtle background (dark glass / dark gradient)

Feels integrated into the UI, not stacked on top

Content Structure

Split the bar into two logical sides:

Left side (System State):

Status label (e.g., “ACCESS ACTIVE”)

Optional subtle indicator dot or icon

Secondary metadata (e.g., “30 days remaining”)

Right side (Personalization Context):

What this hub is configured for

Examples:

“Configured for: Hamilton County, OH”

“Track: Beginner / Starter”

Copy Tone

Calm

Technical

Confident

Zero hype

Avoid:

Emojis

Marketing language

Exclamation points

Visual Style Constraints

❌ No bright green success banners

❌ No alert-style boxes

❌ No heavy borders

❌ No glow

Use:

Subtle separators

Muted accent color (teal is acceptable)

Light typography hierarchy

Deliverables

Provide:

A visual description of the bar

Exact text examples

Suggested spacing and alignment

This bar should make the page feel like a live system dashboard, not a content page.
