### Guide 1: The "Part-Time Power" Hero & Authority

Goal: In 5 seconds, the user must feel: "This is the professional system I need to find deals on my limited schedule."

#### ✅ Change: The Hero Headline & Visual

- Old: "The Intelligence Layer for Probate Investing" (Too abstract/techy).

- New: "The Automated Probate Playbook for the Professional Investor."

- Sub-headline: "The only system that turns 20 years of probate expertise into a guided 'Next-Action' dashboard. Built for investors who need consistent deals without the full-time grind."

- The Visual (Critical): Do NOT use a generic AI graphic. Use a "System View" mockup. Show a single "Case Card" that has a PB-03 Score and a clear instruction like: "Playbook Action: Send 'Inventory Filed' Letter."

#### ✅ Change: The "Founder-Led" Authority Block

- Placement: Immediately below the Hero.

- Content: A "provenance" block.

- "Proprietary logic trained on $50M+ in transactions."

- "Built by [Your Name] for the [Community Name] Inner Circle."

- "This isn't software built by developers. It’s a system built by investors."
