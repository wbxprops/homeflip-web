# Claude Prompt — Homeflip.ai Resource Hub: Community Workspace (2-Column Locked Module)

You are a **senior SaaS product designer** redesigning a page inside the **Homeflip.ai Resource Hub**.

This page is accessed via a **magic link** and must feel like an **internal product surface**, not a marketing page.

---

## Product Context

Homeflip.ai is an AI-powered CRM for real estate investors focused on probate deals.

The Resource Hub contains several **locked or optional system modules**, such as:
- Claim Your County (probate data access)
- Feature upgrades
- External-but-integrated workspaces

This page represents the **Community Workspace**, which is hosted externally (on Skool) but treated as a **system capability** inside Homeflip.ai.

Mental model:
> Community = optional workspace module  
> Not a course catalog, not a promotional page

---

## Core Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)

- Preserve the **CRM illusion**
- Calm, operational, system-first tone
- No marketing language or funnel patterns
- No hype, urgency, or persuasion
- One clear primary action only
- Consistent with the **Claim Your County / locked upgrade** visual pattern

If anything feels like a landing page, course catalog, or invite flow, it is wrong.

---

## Layout Requirement (Critical)

Use a **2-column locked-module layout**, matching the existing:
- Claim Your County
- Locked probate feature upgrade sections

### Column Intent

- **Left column:** Context, explanation, and how the module is used  
- **Right column:** Status, access level, and primary action

This layout consistency is required.

---

## Page Header

Title:
**Community Workspace**

Subtle subheadline (quiet, system tone):
Used by Homeflip.ai investors for discussion, guidance, and live sessions.

No invitation language. No hype.

---

## Primary Card (2-Column Layout)

### LEFT COLUMN — About This Workspace

Section label:
`ABOUT THIS WORKSPACE`

Content should read like **internal system documentation**, not benefits.

Include concise bullet points such as:
- Shared discussion space for active Homeflip.ai investors  
- Used for probate-specific questions and deal feedback  
- Weekly live deal breakdowns and Q&A sessions  
- System announcements related to county access and updates  
- Structured programs including **D2S Property Magnet** and **Real Estate Empires**  

Rules:
- Text-only
- No thumbnails, icons, or cards
- Programs referenced once, with no links or CTAs
- No descriptions of modules, lessons, or outcomes

---

### RIGHT COLUMN — Workspace Status

Section label:
`WORKSPACE STATUS`

Display a simple, readable status stack:

- **Status:** Not connected (or Connected)
- **Access level:** Included
- **Workspace type:** Community

Primary CTA (single, high-emphasis button):
**Open Community Workspace ↗**

Subtext (small, neutral):
Opens the Homeflip.ai community in a new workspace

Optional small footnote (very muted):
Hosted externally

Avoid:
- The word “Join”
- “Free” positioning
- Credit card language
- Multiple CTAs

---

## Skool Treatment Rules

- Skool must NOT be a hero element
- No large logos or promo cards
- Treated strictly as infrastructure
- Mentioned only as an implementation detail (if at all)

The user should feel they are opening a **Homeflip.ai workspace**, not leaving the product.

---

## What to Avoid (Strict)

- No course catalogs
- No feature/benefit tiles
- No testimonials
- No progress bars
- No emojis or playful tone
- No sales or marketing copy
- No secondary CTAs

---

## Visual Tone

- Serious
- Calm
- Confident
- Internal-tool energy

The finished page should feel like:
> “This is another system module, just like county access.”

---

## Output Instructions

Provide:
- A redesigned layout description
- Updated UI copy for all visible text
- Brief rationale for layout and hierarchy decisions

Do NOT include implementation code.
