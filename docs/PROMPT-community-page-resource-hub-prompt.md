# Claude Prompt — Magic Link Resource Hub: Community Page (Bridge Surface)

You are a **senior SaaS product designer** working on **Homeflip.ai**.

Your task is to redesign the **Community page inside the Magic Link Resource Hub**.

This page is **not** the CRM and **not** a hype landing page.  
It is a **bridge surface** between marketing and the CRM.

If there is any ambiguity, default to the guidance below.

---

## Product & Funnel Context (Critical)

Homeflip.ai has three surfaces:

1. **Marketing site** — high-energy, persuasive
2. **Magic Link Resource Hub (THIS PAGE)** — warm, content-rich, trust-building
3. **CRM** — cold, operational, non-salesy

This Community page lives in **#2**.

It must:
- Still support conversion
- Still feel valuable on repeat visits
- Avoid hype, pressure, or funnel tricks

The hub is accessed via a **magic link**:
- No login
- No account
- No onboarding

The goal is for prospects to **return repeatedly**, consume content, and grow confident before becoming customers.

---

## What This Page Is

This page represents the **Homeflip.ai Community** hosted on **Skool**.

Skool is:
- Well-known
- Acceptable to name directly
- Not the hero

This page should feel like:
> “One of the main rooms inside the Homeflip.ai ecosystem.”

Not:
> “A link out to a third-party coaching platform.”

---

## Design Goals

- Warm, credible, and content-forward
- Clearly communicates *what exists inside the community*
- Encourages joining without pressure
- Feels alive, not minimal or cold
- Supports repeat visits

Marketing energy is allowed, but restrained.

---

## Layout Requirements

### Overall Structure
- Use a **2-column layout** for the primary section
- This should visually match other “locked / upgrade” sections in the hub

### Visual Hierarchy
1. Page title
2. Primary 2-column community card
3. Feature / capability tiles below

---

## Page Header

**Community Workspace**

Subheadline (warm, confident):
A private investor community used by Homeflip.ai members for training, discussion, and deal support.

---

## Primary Section — 2 Column Card

### LEFT COLUMN — About the Community

Purpose:
Explain *why this community matters* and *what kind of activity happens here*.

Tone:
- Confident
- Specific
- Not hypey

Example themes to cover (rewrite in your own words):
- Private Skool community for Homeflip.ai investors
- Real probate deal discussions and Q&A
- Weekly live calls and live trainings
- Ongoing support between deals

This is allowed to sound marketing-adjacent, but not salesy.

---

### RIGHT COLUMN — Status & Primary Action

Purpose:
Create a clear, low-friction next step.

Include:
- A short, human-friendly status line (e.g. “You haven’t joined yet”)
- One **primary CTA only**

Primary CTA text (use one of these, or something equivalent):
- **Join the Homeflip.ai Community on Skool**
- **Open the Homeflip.ai Community (Skool)**

Helper text (important):
Opens the Homeflip.ai investor community on Skool in a new tab.

Do NOT:
- Show pricing
- Show access levels
- Require login
- Add secondary CTAs

---

## Secondary Section — Included Inside the Community

This section exists to **sell depth, not urgency**.

### Section Title
**Included with Community Access**

Optional subtext:
All of the following is included inside the Homeflip.ai community.

---

## Feature / Capability Tiles (Allowed & Encouraged)

Feature boxes ARE allowed here.

Rules:
- No CTAs inside tiles
- No pricing language
- No urgency or scarcity
- No “enroll now” phrasing

Each tile should describe **what exists**, not persuade.

### Required Tiles

Include tiles for:

**Live Weekly Calls**  
Open Q&A and real deal discussions.

**Live Weekly Trainings**  
Hands-on training sessions covering probate and acquisition strategy.

**D2S Property Magnet**  
End-to-end off-market property acquisition system.  
Self-guided · Included

**Real Estate Empires**  
Foundational real estate investing course for newer investors.  
Self-guided · Included

---

## Tone Calibration (Very Important)

This page should feel:
- More valuable and alive than the CRM
- Less hypey than the marketing site

If the marketing site is 100% sales energy and the CRM is 0%, this page should feel around **50–60%**.

The emotional goal:
> “There’s a lot here. I should probably check this out.”

---

## What to Avoid (Strict)

- No course catalogs
- No lesson/module breakdowns
- No testimonials
- No countdowns
- No aggressive copy
- No funnel language
- No progress bars

---

## Output Instructions

Provide:
- A redesigned layout description
- Suggested UI copy for headings, body text, and buttons
- Brief rationale for layout and tone decisions

Do NOT include implementation code.

---

If this page feels like a **private, content-rich hub that invites return visits**, you’ve done it correctly.
