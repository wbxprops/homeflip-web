You are working on a short-form landing page for Homeflip.ai, a premium real estate investing platform.

GLOBAL GOAL:
The page should feel modern, calm, intelligent, and high-conviction — not salesy, not gimmicky, not blog-like.

This is NOT a marketing page for beginners.
It is an intrigue-driven page for serious real estate investors.

OVERALL LOOK & FEEL:
- Clean, premium, tech-forward
- Calm confidence (nothing loud or flashy)
- Feels like a system, not a pitch
- Visual rhythm and motion, not clutter

COLOR & BRAND RULES:
- Dark, restrained background tones
- Teal accent used sparingly for emphasis (e.g. key concepts like “Timeline Intelligence”)
- No bright or saturated colors
- No gradients that feel decorative
- No stock-photo energy

TYPOGRAPHY RULES:
- One primary font family throughout the page
- Use font weight, size, and spacing for hierarchy — not font switching
- Headlines: confident, restrained, high contrast
- Body text: readable, calm, no marketing hype

IMAGE & GRAPHIC RULES:
- No stock photos of houses, people, keys, or cities
- Prefer abstract visuals, diagrams, charts, timelines, or UI-style graphics
- All images should feel informational, not emotional
- Use placeholders where real graphs or visuals will later be added
- Placeholder labels should clearly describe the intent of the graphic

MOTION & INTERACTION RULES:
- Subtle motion only (fade, slide, reveal)
- No bounce, no parallax overload, no gimmicky animation
- Motion should support understanding, not draw attention to itself
- Not every section should animate — alternate static and animated sections
- Animations should feel intentional and quiet

SECTION VARIETY RULES:
- Do NOT make every section look the same
- Alternate between:
  - headline + bullets
  - headline + short narrative
  - headline + graphic + blurb
  - headline + callout box
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment across sections

CONTENT RULES:
- Do not over-explain
- Do not teach tactics yet
- Do not use hype language (“secrets”, “crush”, “hack”, “explode”)
- Favor inevitability and clarity over persuasion
- Every section should increase curiosity, not resolve it

CTA PHILOSOPHY:
- No pressure tactics
- No countdowns
- No fake urgency
- The page should feel like the obvious next step is to download the guide

All subsequent section instructions must follow this guide.
Acknowledge and confirm before proceeding.
