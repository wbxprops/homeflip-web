You are designing Section 2 of a short-form landing page for real estate investors.

SECTION PURPOSE:
Position probate as one of the most reliable off-market sources — not a niche tactic.

VISUAL STYLE:
- Clean headline at top
- Left-aligned bullet list beneath it
- Optional small icon or checkmark per bullet
- Static section (no animation required)

CONTENT DIRECTION:
- Focus on benefits, not tactics
- Compare probate implicitly against crowded lead sources (MLS, lists, cold outreach)
- Emphasize reliability, motivation, and consistency

BULLET THEMES:
- As-is properties
- Motivated decision-makers
- Less emotional attachment
- Fewer bidding wars
- Opportunities before public listings

GUARDRAILS:
- No step-by-step instructions
- No legal talk
- No overpromising timelines or profits
- Avoid words like “hack”, “secret”, or “easy”

OUTPUT:
- Section headline
- 5–6 concise benefit bullets
