### Guide 4: High-Scarcity "County Terminal"

Goal: To move "Claim Your County" from a marketing slogan to a real "Resource Scarcity" trigger.

#### ✅ Change: The County Checker

- The Look: Make it look like a Live Inventory Terminal.

- The Content: Instead of a list, use a high-contrast box for their specific market.

- "STATUS: BUTLER COUNTY, OH"

- "INVENTORY: 3 OF 5 SLOTS REMAINING"

- "ALERT: Founder Pricing locks in for the next 2 members only."

- The Logic: Part-time investors hate missing out on an "edge." If they see their county is "Filling Fast," they will click the CTA just to protect their future opportunity.
