### Summary of the "Opinionated" Polish:

1. Remove "Database" imagery. Replace with "Action" imagery.

2. Stop talking about "AI features." Start talking about "Decision support."

3. Bridge the gap. Explicitly state that this is the official platform for your free coaching.

4. Tone Check: Ensure the copy sounds like a Peer-to-Peer conversation (Expert Investor to Aspiring Investor), not a Vendor-to-Customer pitch.

How to use these: Use Guide 1 for your Hero section, Guide 2 to replace the middle "How it works" section, and Guide 3 to replace the "Not just software" section. Your CRM comparison.

Also review Guide 4 and 5 6.
