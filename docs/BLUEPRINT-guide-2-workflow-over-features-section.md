### Guide 2: The "Workflow over Features" Section

Goal: To prove this is a "Vehicle" and not a "CRM" (which sounds like manual labor).

#### ✅ Replace: "CRM vs. Intelligence" with "The Tuesday Night Workflow"

Create a three-column visual showing the "Part-Timer’s Path":

1. Column 1: The Intake (1 Minute)

- Copy: "While you're at your day job, our AI is at the courthouse. It filters the noise, identifies property equity, and scores every case."

- Visual: A notification on a phone: "New PB-03 Case identified in Hamilton County."

1. Column 2: The Decision (2 Minutes)

- Copy: "Don't guess what to say. The platform tells you exactly where the family is in the process. Open the Playbook, grab the script, and act."

- Visual: A snippet of a Guided Action script.

1. Column 3: The Execution (12 Minutes)

- Copy: "Use our integrated workflows to send your outreach. Then, close your laptop. The system monitors for status changes and alerts you when it’s time to follow up."

- Visual: A "Success" checkmark.
