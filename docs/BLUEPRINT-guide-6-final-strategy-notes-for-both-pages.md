### 1. The Home Page (homeflip.ai)

The Goal: Move them from "Frustrated with normal leads" to "I need this specific probate system."

- Apply Guide 1 (Authority): Move your "20 Years / $50M" track record to the top. The "Dear Investor" letter is great, but it needs an "Executive Summary" above it. Part-timers are busy; give them the "Authority Punch" before the long read.

- Apply Guide 3 (Community/Coaching): This is most critical here. Since the Home Page is about the "Why," you need to frame the platform as the Official Implementation of your community's strategies.

- The UX Shift: Keep the "Sales Letter" feel, but "break up" the text with UI Teasers. Don't wait until the bottom to show the software. As you mention a problem (e.g., "stale lists"), show a small UI snippet of your "Live Syncing" to prove you've fixed it.

### 2. The Platform Page (/platform)

The Goal: Move them from "I'm interested in probate" to "This is the only software I trust to execute my Tuesday night workflow."

- Apply Guide 2 (Workflow): This is the "Hero" of this page. You shouldn't be selling "The Inventory Crisis" here (they are already on the platform page; they know the crisis). You should be selling the 15-minute workflow.

- Apply Guide 4 (The Terminal): The "County Scarcity" should be much more interactive and "hard-coded" here. It should feel like they are "checking out" of a store.

- The UX Shift: Decrease text, increase UI. Replace the long descriptions of "Timeline Intelligence" with a high-fidelity graphic of a Case moving through PB-01 to PB-03. Show, don't just tell.

|The Community|Narrative: "Join our community of investors."|Integration: "Get the coaching included with the tech."|
|The UI|"Teasers": Small, blurry, or stylized snippets.|"Evidence": Large, clear, annotated mockups.|
|The CTA|"Check Availability" (Curiosity-driven).|"Claim Your County" (Action-driven).|

### Final Strategy Note for Both Pages:

Because you are targeting part-time investors, the biggest "Conversion Killer" on both pages is the fear of Complexity.

- On the Home Page, you combat this with your Authority (I've done the hard work for you).

- On the Platform Page, you combat this with the Workflow (The system tells you exactly what to do).

My recommendation: Start with the Platform Page updates. It’s the "bottom of the funnel." If that page is clear and proves the "Vehicle" works, your Home Page will naturally convert better because the destination it points to is more legitimate.
