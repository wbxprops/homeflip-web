### Guide: The "Techy" Platform Page Architecture

Goal: Prove the "Timeline Intelligence™" logic is robust, proprietary, and worth the investment.

#### 1. The "Architecture" Hero

- Visual: Instead of a single dashboard shot, use an exploded view or an "Architecture Blueprint" of the system.

- Copy: "The Architecture of Timing. How we turn raw court data into prioritized deal flow."

- The Hook: Acknowledge their skepticism. "Most 'AI' in real estate is just a skin on a database. Here is how our actual intelligence layer functions."

#### 2. Section: "The Data Pipeline" (The Ingestion Layer)

Techy users care about data integrity.

- Explain the Sync: Don't just say "we get leads." Explain the Court-Sync Engine.

- The Detail: "Our system monitors 3,000+ county portals. We don't just scrape names; we ingest case numbers, fiduciary roles, and filing types."

- Visual: A stylized data-flow diagram showing: County Courts → Homeflip Ingestion → Data Normalization.

#### 3. Section: "The PB-Score™ Algorithm" (The Brain)

This is where you explain the "Timeline Intelligence" they are curious about.

- The Logic: "A PB-Score isn't random. It’s a weighted calculation based on 4 key variables:"

1. Lifecycle Stage: (Filing vs. Inventory vs. Resolution).

2. Asset Verification: (Cross-referenced property data).

3. Case Velocity: (How fast is this specific court moving?).

4. Equity Ratio: (Estimated debt vs. market value).

- Visual: A "Logic Block" diagram. Show how a case "travels" from a PB-01 to a PB-03 based on these triggers.

#### 4. Section: "Data Enrichment & LLM Processing"

Since you mentioned "AI," explain the actual use of it.

- Copy: "Using LLMs to read the 'Unstructured' Data."

- The Tech: Explain that your system reads the actual court PDFs (Inventory lists, etc.) to extract property addresses that are often hidden in the "notes" of a case.

- The Value: "We find the property before it’s even recorded in the tax assessor's office. That is your 2-week head start."

#### 5. Section: "The Execution Layer" (The Guided Action)

Even techy people want to know the output.

- Copy: "API-Driven Workflows."

- The Detail: Explain how the system triggers "Playbooks." If a PB-Score hits 03, the system automatically surfaces the correct "Motivated Heir" script and letter template.

- Visual: A screenshot of the Code/Logic behind a Playbook (e.g., If Status = 'Inventory Filed' AND Equity > 40%, THEN Trigger 'Playbook B').

### 🔧 Strategic UX Adjustments for the "Techy" Page:

1. Use "Systems" Language: Use words like Latency, Normalization, Variables, Triggers, and Logic Gates. This signals that you speak their language.

2. The "Glass Box" Approach: Show a "Case History" log. Let them see how the system tracked a case for 6 months before flagging it as "Ready to Sell." This is the ultimate proof.

3. The "Moat" explanation: Explicitly tell them: "You could build this yourself, but it would take 3 years of court-syncing and 20 years of deal data to train the model. We've done that work for you."

### Summary: Home Page vs. Platform Page (Techy version)

- Home Page: "I will help you find deals on your Tuesday nights so you can build wealth." (The Promise)

- Platform Page: "Here is the proprietary data pipeline and scoring algorithm that makes the Tuesday night workflow possible." (The Proof)

By separating them this way, you satisfy the emotional part-timer on the homepage and the skeptical optimizer on the platform page. Both roads lead to the same "Claim Your County" CTA.
