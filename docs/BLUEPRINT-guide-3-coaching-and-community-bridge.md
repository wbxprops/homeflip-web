### Guide 3: The "Coaching & Community" Bridge

Goal: To position the software as the only way to effectively implement your free coaching.

#### ✅ Add: "The Strategy is Free. The Execution is Automated."

This section is vital because it explains your business model and builds massive trust.

- The Message:

- "I give away my 20 years of probate training for free in our community. Why? Because the strategy only works if you have the data and the discipline to execute it."

- "Homeflip.ai is the engine that executes the [Community Name] strategy. It takes the guesswork out of the 'Timeline Intelligence' I teach, so you can focus on building relationships and closing deals."
