You are a senior product designer working on a pre-signup resource hub for an AI-powered real estate investing platform called Homeflip.ai.

Your task is to design **Version 1 (Minimal)** of a “Probate Profit Machine” resource hub that must:
- Ship immediately
- Support paid ads
- Avoid overwhelming prospects
- Feel professional, credible, and system-driven

## Core Constraints
- This page is for prospects, not logged-in users
- Do NOT reference specific counties or personal data
- Do NOT over-promote the founder
- Do NOT present this as a full course platform

## Primary Goal
Help prospects:
1. Understand probate investing
2. See proof of real expertise
3. Identify a clear next step (Claim Your County)

## Required Sections (V1 Only)

1. **System Status Bar**
   - Copy: “● ACCESS ACTIVE · 30 days remaining”
   - Calm, technical, non-marketing

2. **Resource Identity**
   - Title: Probate Profit Machine
   - Subtext explaining it is a practical introduction to probate investing

3. **Learn Probate Investing**
   - Feature the Probate Profit Machine PDF
   - One clear action: Download or Read
   - No course language

4. **Live Probate Training Replays**
   - Show 2–3 selected live training videos
   - Frame as real sessions, not content marketing

5. **Ongoing Support (Optional)**
   - Soft CTA to a free Skool community
   - Frame as access to discussion and live training

6. **Primary Conversion CTA**
   - Claim Your County
   - No urgency or hype language

## Output
Provide:
- Section structure
- Section titles
- Copy tone guidance
- Clear hierarchy

This is a minimal, launch-safe version only.
