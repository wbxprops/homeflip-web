## 🎯 What I Need to Know

### Current Focus
**Active Work:** Pivot the Thank You page from "probate education" to "sell the strategy call". Incorporating high-end glassmorphism and stunning before/after property galleries.

### Session History
#### 2026-02-13 (FB Event Deduplication & Coverage Fix)
- ✅ **Shared eventId**: All forms now generate one ID passed to both `fbq()` and Conversions API for proper dedup
- ✅ **_fbp/_fbc cookies**: Auto-extracted from browser and included in every server-side CAPI call
- ✅ **CTAForm server-side**: Added `sendConversionEvent('Contact')` — was the "1 fewer event" gap
- ✅ **booking-activation tracking**: Added full Calendly tracking (was completely untracked)
- ✅ **StrategyCallSurvey**: Now `await`s server call before redirect
- ✅ **Deployed**: Commit `b12bc83`, 7 files changed
- **Session log:** `docs/session-logs/2026-02-13-fb-event-deduplication-fix.md`

#### 2026-02-08 (Prospect Upsert RLS Fix)
- ✅ **Bug Found**: `prospects` table upserts silently failing — RLS blocks anon key, error only console.error'd
- ✅ **Root Cause**: `prospect_responses` has explicit anon INSERT policy; `prospects` does not. HVCO form works via n8n webhook (server-side)
- ✅ **Fix**: Created `/api/prospects/upsert` API route with service key, updated ClaimCountyForm, CTAForm, PreStrategySurveyForm
- ✅ **Backfill**: 6 missing prospects manually inserted (including 2 callers for tomorrow)
- ✅ **Deployed**: Commit `9fa901b`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` added to Vercel env
- **Session log:** `docs/session-logs/2026-02-08-prospect-upsert-rls-fix.md`

#### 2026-02-06 (FB Pixel Race Condition Fix + AC Automation #59)
- ✅ **Race Condition Fix**: `trackLeadFull()` now async + awaited before redirect — Lead events were being killed
- ✅ **Deployed**: Commit `6391b16`, includes Schedule event tracking on booking pages
- ✅ **Domain Verified**: homeflip.ai verified in Meta Business Manager
- ✅ **Domains Allowlisted**: Both homeflip.ai and homeflip-web.vercel.app on pixel
- ✅ **AC Tag Mapping**: Mapped old D2S tags → PPM tags for Automation #59
- ✅ **README Updated**: Automation #26 → #59
- **Tomorrow**: Goal condition setup, remaining automations
- **Session log:** `docs/session-logs/2026-02-06-fb-pixel-race-condition-fix.md`

#### 2026-01-22 (Facebook Pixel + Conversions API)

- ✅ **Conversions API Setup**: Server-side tracking for Lead, Schedule, CompleteRegistration, Contact events
- ✅ **Environment Config**: Created `.env.local`, added vars to Vercel production
- ✅ **TrackingScripts.tsx**: Added FB Pixel client-side code + helper functions
- ✅ **API Route**: Created `/api/fb-conversions` for server-side event tracking

## 🏗️ Project Architecture Quick Reference

### Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS
- **Hosting:** Vercel (free tier, auto-deploy from GitHub)
- **Database:** Supabase (for waitlist form, shared with homeflip-crm)
- **Font:** IBM Plex Sans (body), Adobe Fonts (headlines)
- **Version Control:** GitHub

### Key Patterns
- Light theme for marketing (AuraLight)
- Pure white backgrounds with plenty of white space
- High-contrast slate text for readability
- Gradient buttons (dark cyan → deep purple) for primary CTAs
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Long-form educational content with icons and bullet points

### Deployment
- Push to `main` branch auto-deploys to Vercel
- No build command needed - Vercel auto-detects Next.js

---

## ⚠️ Critical Things to Remember

### Architecture Decision (2025-12-22)
**PIVOTED from WordPress/Elementor to Next.js/Vercel** because:
- Claude Code can write the code directly - no CMS needed
- Better developer experience and version control
- Easier integration with Supabase for forms
- Free hosting on Vercel
- Future vision: Multi-tenant user website system

### DO NOT:
- ❌ Use dark theme (that's for CRM)
- ❌ Be hypey or "guru" vibe
- ❌ Get too technical about probate law
- ❌ Make it "black + neon SaaS" cliché

### ALWAYS:
- ✅ Keep messaging consistent with guide-website-overview.md
- ✅ Tone: Clear, confident, outcome-driven, practical
- ✅ Include clear CTAs on every section
- ✅ Test on mobile devices
- ✅ Use brand gradient for primary buttons
- ✅ **Ensure HVCO landing page (`/probate-profit-machine`) looks good on mobile** - bold headlines, readable copy, smooth animations
